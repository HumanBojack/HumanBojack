# HumanBojack / Romain
## More about me:
My name is **Romain**, I'm a **20 years old french developer** currently studying in my hometown.
In the begining of 2021, I did a **6 month course on web developement** where I wrote code for the first time in my life. I especially liked back end part (*ruby on rails*).

After that, I took a **6 months hiatus** from coding. I hated that.

I finally joined another course that started in the begining of 2022! This one is about data science and artificial intelligence. I'm so glad to be back in the coding world! You'll probably see a few new projects on here related to this :)
